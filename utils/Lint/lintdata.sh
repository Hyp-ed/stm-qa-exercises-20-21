#!/bin/bash
# A script to lint all .cpp/.hpp files in a directory for extra data and info,
#   with configured linter. It prints the number of 
#   passed/failed source/header files, the number of 
#   NOLINTS used, and the number of 
#   non-comment, non-empty lines scanned, 
#   as well as how many of them were in passed source/header files

# Note that this significantly slower than just calling 'python presubmit.py'
#   only use this if you need the extra data

# Call with --verbose to print all messages from linter
# Call with --dir={name} to lint files in ./{name}
# Call with --onlyerr to only print error messages when file fails linter

# If both --verbose and --onlyerr are called, the last option passed will be used
